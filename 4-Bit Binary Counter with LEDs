# 4-Bit Binary Counter with LEDs (Manual Implementation)

This project shows a simple 4-bit binary counter using four LEDs connected to digital pins 2, 7, 8, and 12 on an Arduino board.  
The program manually writes each binary combination from 0 to 15, turning LEDs on or off according to the corresponding bit value.

This exercise helps beginners understand:
- How digital pins control LEDs
- How binary numbers work
- How to structure repetitive LED patterns
- The basics of timing with `delay()`

int tempo = 4000;

void setup() {
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);

}

void loop() {

  // 0
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);

## Circuit Setup

Components required:
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- 4 LEDs
- 4 × 220Ω resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### Wiring Instructions
Each LED must be connected as follows:

- Anode (long leg) → Arduino pin (2, 7, 8, or 12) through a 220Ω resistor  
- Cathode (short leg) → GND  

Text-based wiring diagram:

```
Pin 12 ──[220Ω]──►|── GND
Pin 8  ──[220Ω]──►|── GND
Pin 7  ──[220Ω]──►|── GND
Pin 2  ──[220Ω]──►|── GND
```

## How It Works

The sketch manually cycles through all binary numbers from 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111).  
Each LED represents one bit of a 4-bit binary number:
- Pin 2 = Most significant bit (MSB)
- Pin 7 = Bit 2
- Pin 8 = Bit 1
- Pin 12 = Least significant bit (LSB)

Every 4 seconds, the next binary combination is shown on the LEDs.

## Notes

This project is meant to help beginners understand how binary numbers can be represented using LEDs and digital pins.  
The logic is intentionally written in a simple, repetitive way to make the pattern easy to study.
