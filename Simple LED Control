# Simple LED Control (Basic Arduino Example)

This project is a very simple Arduino exercise where multiple LEDs are connected to digital pins.  
The code turns all LEDs off and then switches on only the LED connected to pin 12, repeating this every second.

It is designed for beginners who want to practice:
- digital output  
- pin configuration  
- timing using `delay()`  

---

## Arduino Code

```cpp
int tempo = 1000;

void setup() {
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);
  delay(tempo);

  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
  delay(tempo);
}
```

##  Circuit Setup

You will need:
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 4 × LEDs  
- 4 × 220Ω resistors  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard  

### Wiring:
Each LED connects in the same way:

- **Anode (long leg)** → Arduino pin (2, 7, 8, or 12) through a **220Ω resistor**  
- **Cathode (short leg)** → GND  

Schematic (text-based):

```
Pin 12 ──[220Ω]──►|── GND
Pin 8  ──[220Ω]──►|── GND
Pin 7  ──[220Ω]──►|── GND
Pin 2  ──[220Ω]──►|── GND
```

##  What Happens

1. All LEDs are turned OFF.  
2. After 1 second, only the LED on **pin 12** turns ON.  
3. After another second, the cycle repeats.  

This is a basic example for learning digital outputs and timing.


## Notes
- This project is meant for beginners.  
- The code intentionally keeps the logic simple to help new users understand how Arduino pins work.
