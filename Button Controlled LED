Button Controlled LED

This project demonstrates how to control an LED using a push button.  
The LED turns on or off depending on the state of the button, while also printing the button state to the Serial Monitor.

This project is useful for beginners to learn:
- Reading digital input from a button  
- Controlling an LED with `digitalWrite()`  
- Using `Serial.print()` for debugging  



Arduino Code

```cpp
int LedPin = 8;
int buttonPin = 12;
int buttonRead;
int dt = 100;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(LedPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  buttonRead = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  Serial.println(buttonRead);
  delay(dt);

  if (buttonRead == 1) {
    digitalWrite(LedPin, LOW);
  }

  if (buttonRead == 0) {
    digitalWrite(LedPin, HIGH);
  }
}


Circuit Setup

Components needed:
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 1 × LED  
- 1 × 220Ω resistor  
- 1 × push button  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  

Wiring Instructions:
1. LED 
   - Anode → pin 8 through 220Ω resistor  
   - Cathode → GND  

2. **Push Button**  
   - One leg → pin 12  
   - Other leg → GND  

How it works:
- When the button is pressed, `digitalRead(buttonPin)` reads LOW (0) and the LED turns on.  
- When the button is released, it reads HIGH (1) and the LED turns off.  
- The button state is also printed to the Serial Monitor every 100ms.
