  LED PWM Brightness Control

  Description:
  This code controls the brightness of a single LED using PWM. 
  The LED gradually switches between four brightness levels:
  off, low, medium, and high. Each level is kept for a fixed amount of time.

  How to build it:
  - Connect a red LED to pin 9 through a 220Ω resistor.
  - Connect the LED's cathode to the GND pin.
  - Upload the code to your Arduino board.


int redLed = 9;
int off = 0;
int low = 50;
int medium = 100;
int high = 220;
int time = 3000;

void setup() {
  pinMode(redLed, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  analogWrite(redLed, off);
  delay(time);

  analogWrite(redLed, low);
  delay(time);

  analogWrite(redLed, medium);
  delay(time);

  analogWrite(redLed, high);
  delay(time);
}
