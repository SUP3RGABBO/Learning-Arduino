Serial Input LED Blinker

This project allows the user to control the number of times an LED blinks by entering a number through the Serial Monitor.  
It is a simple exercise for beginners to practice:
- Reading input from Serial  
- Using loops to control LEDs  
- Timing with `delay()`  

---

Arduino Code

```cpp
int numBlinks;
String msg = "How many blinks do you want:";
int j;
int bt = 500;
int redPin = 12;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println(msg);
  while (Serial.available() == 0) {}

  numBlinks = Serial.parseInt();
  for (j = 1; j <= numBlinks; j = j + 1) {
    digitalWrite(redPin, HIGH);
    delay(bt);
    digitalWrite(redPin, LOW);
    delay(bt);
  }
}


Circuit Setup

Components needed:
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 1 × LED (red)  
- 1 × 220Ω resistor  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  

Wiring Instructions:
- LED anode (long leg) → Arduino pin **12** through 220Ω resistor  
- LED cathode (short leg) → GND  

How it works:
1. Open the Serial Monitor at 9600 baud.  
2. Enter the number of blinks you want.  
3. The LED on pin 12 will blink the specified number of times with 500ms intervals.
