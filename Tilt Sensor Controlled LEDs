Tilt Sensor Controlled LEDs

This project uses a tilt sensor to control two LEDs.  
Depending on the tilt sensor state, either the green LED or the red LED turns on.

This project helps beginners learn:
- Reading digital input from a tilt sensor  
- Controlling LEDs with `digitalWrite()`  
- Using Serial Monitor for debugging

 Arduino Code

```cpp
int tiltVal;
int tiltPin = 2;
int redLed = 11;
int greenLed = 9;

void setup() {
  pinMode(tiltPin, INPUT);
  digitalWrite(tiltPin, HIGH); // Enable internal pull-up resistor
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(greenLed, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(redLed, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  tiltVal = digitalRead(tiltPin);
  Serial.println(tiltVal);

  if (tiltVal == 1) {
    digitalWrite(greenLed, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(redLed, LOW);
  }

  if (tiltVal == 0) {
    digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(redLed, HIGH);
  }
}
```

Circuit Setup

Components needed:
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 1 × Tilt sensor  
- 2 × LEDs (green and red)  
- 2 × 220Ω resistors  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  

Wiring Instructions:
1. Tilt sensor
   - One leg → pin 2  
   - Other leg → GND (internal pull-up used in code)  

2.LEDs  
   - Green LED anode → pin 9 through 220Ω resistor, cathode → GND  
   - Red LED anode → pin 11 through 220Ω resistor, cathode → GND  

How it works:
- The tilt sensor reads HIGH (1) when upright and LOW (0) when tilted.  
- When upright, the green LED turns on; when tilted, the red LED turns on.  
- Serial Monitor prints the tilt sensor state for monitoring.
