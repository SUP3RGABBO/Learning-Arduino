Analog Sensor Controlled RGB LED (Red & Blue)

This project uses an analog sensor to control the brightness of two LEDs (red and blue) simultaneously.
The voltage read from the sensor is mapped to the LED brightness to create a dynamic color effect.

This project helps beginners learn:
-Reading analog sensor values with analogRead
-Mapping sensor voltage to LED brightness
-Controlling LED brightness with analogWrite
-Using Serial Monitor for debugging

Arduino Code
float intensity;
int intPin = A1;
int redPin = 9;
int bluePin = 11;
float volt;
int dt = 150;

float redBright;
float blueBright;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(bluePin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Read analog sensor value
  intensity = analogRead(intPin);
  volt = (5.0 / 1023.0) * intensity;
  Serial.println(volt);
  delay(dt);

  // Map sensor voltage to LED brightness
  redBright = 51.0 * volt;
  blueBright = (-51.0 * volt) + 255.0;

  // Set LED brightness
  analogWrite(redPin, redBright);
  analogWrite(bluePin, blueBright);
}

Circuit Setup
Components needed:
Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
1 × Analog sensor (e.g., potentiometer or light sensor)
1 × Red LED
1 × Blue LED
2 × 220Ω resistors
Breadboard
Jumper wires

Wiring Instructions:

Analog Sensor
Signal → A1
VCC → 5V
GND → GND

Red LED
Anode → pin 9 through 220Ω resistor
Cathode → GND

Blue LED
Anode → pin 11 through 220Ω resistor
Cathode → GND

How it works:
The analog sensor voltage is read via analogRead.
The red LED brightness increases with the sensor voltage, while the blue LED decreases.
analogWrite adjusts LED brightness smoothly.

Serial Monitor prints the sensor voltage for debugging.
