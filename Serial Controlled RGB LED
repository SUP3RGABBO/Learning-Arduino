Serial Controlled RGB LED

This project allows the user to control an RGB LED using the Serial Monitor.  
The user can type "red", "green", "blue", or "OFF" to turn on a specific LED or turn them all off.  

This project helps beginners learn:
- Reading strings from Serial input  
- Controlling multiple LEDs with conditional statements  
- Using `digitalWrite()` to turn LEDs on/off  



Arduino Code

```cpp
String Colour;
String msg = "What colour do you want to turn on? If you want nothing turned on write OFF";
String msg2 = "Well, ";
String msg3 = " LED has been turned on";

int redLed = 2;
int greenLed = 8;
int blueLed = 13;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(redLed, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenLed, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(blueLed, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println(msg);
  while (Serial.available() == 0) {}

  Colour = Serial.readString();
  Serial.print(msg2);
  Serial.print(Colour);
  Serial.println(msg3);

  if (Colour == "red") {
    digitalWrite(redLed, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(blueLed, LOW);
  }

  if (Colour == "green") {
    digitalWrite(redLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenLed, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(blueLed, LOW);
  }

  if (Colour == "blue") {
    digitalWrite(redLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(blueLed, HIGH);
  }

  if (Colour == "OFF") {
    digitalWrite(redLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(blueLed, LOW);
  }
}


 Circuit Setup

Components needed:
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 3 × LEDs (red, green, blue)  
- 3 × 220Ω resistors  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  

Wiring Instructions:
- Red LED anode → pin 2 through 220Ω resistor, cathode → GND  
- Green LED anode → pin 8 through 220Ω resistor, cathode → GND  
- Blue LED anode → pin 13 through 220Ω resistor, cathode → GND  

How it works:
1. Open the Serial Monitor at 9600 baud.  
2. Type a colour: "red", "green", "blue", or "OFF".  
3. The corresponding LED will turn on, and all others will turn off.  
4. "OFF" turns all LEDs off.
