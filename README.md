The main goal of this project is to gain some knowledge about Arduino and robotics.
In fact, I created this small section to collect all my simple codes and small projects made while learning Arduino.
As for its purpose, this repository is simply a collection of code to track my progress, review what Iâ€™ve learned, and take one step further with more complex projects over time.
