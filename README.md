The main goal of this project is to give some knowledge to people who are looking for simple codes to learn Arduino and robotics.
When I started learning, I sometimes found it hard to understand the basics, so I decided to create a small space on GitHub where beginners can find clean, simple examples to practice.

In this repository, I’m collecting all the codes and small projects that I made while I was learning Arduino.
I want to give something back to the community, because the community itself has taught me a lot during my journey.

The purpose of this repo is very simple:
-to share beginner-friendly Arduino projects
-to review what I’ve learned so far
-to keep improving and take one step further with more complex projects over time
-to help others understand the fundamentals in an easy, practical way

My code is not perfect, but it’s real code written while learning — mistakes included — because I think this makes the learning experience more genuine and useful for others.

Feel free to explore the examples, use them, modify them, or even contribute.
If my small projects can help even one person get into Arduino or robotics, then this repository has already done its job.
